The 'innodb_stats_transient_sample_pages' knob in MySQL determines the number of index pages to sample when estimating cardinality and other statistics for an indexed column, and you can set its value according to your specific needs, with the default value being 8, but be aware that larger values may increase the accuracy of statistics, but also increase the time taken for statistics estimation.
