{"think_procedure": "First, I looked up the function of the 'innodb_flush_sync' knob in MySQL. I found that it controls whether InnoDB should flush dirty pages synchronously when the system is idle. The default value is ON, which means that InnoDB will flush dirty pages even when the system is idle. If it is set to OFF, InnoDB will not flush dirty pages when the system is idle. However, this knob does not have any special values that break the natural order or perform a very different function compared to its regular operation. Therefore, it is not a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": false}
