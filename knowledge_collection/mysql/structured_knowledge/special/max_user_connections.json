{"think_procedure": "First, understand the function of the 'max_user_connections' knob in MySQL. It is used to limit the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be made by a single MySQL user account. The default value is 0, which means there is no limit. If this knob is set to a positive integer, it will limit the number of simultaneous connections to that number. However, if it is set to 0, it breaks the natural order and performs a different function, i.e., it allows unlimited connections. Therefore, it can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
