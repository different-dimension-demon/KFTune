{"think_procedure": "First, I looked up the function of the 'innodb_change_buffer_max_size' knob in MySQL. I found that it is a numerical knob that specifies the maximum size of the change buffer as a percentage of the total buffer pool size. The value range is from 0 to 50. The default value is 25. If the value is set to 0, it effectively disables the change buffering. This is a special function that breaks the natural order of the knob. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
