{"think_procedure": "First, we need to understand the function of the 'tablespace_definition_cache' knob in MySQL. This knob is used to set the number of tablespace definitions that can be stored in the definition cache. Then, we need to check if there are any special values for this knob that change its function. In this case, the value -1 is a special value that means the number of tablespace definitions that can be stored in the definition cache is unlimited. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
