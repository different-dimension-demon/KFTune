{"think_procedure": "First, I looked at the function of the 'range_optimizer_max_mem_size' knob in MySQL. It controls the maximum memory that the range optimizer can use. Then, I checked if it has any special values that change its behavior significantly. I found that when set to '0', it changes the behavior of the range optimizer to not use index dives and instead estimate the number of rows in the range. This is a significant change in behavior, so I classified it as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
