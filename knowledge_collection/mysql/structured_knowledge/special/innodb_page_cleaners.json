{"think_procedure": "First, I looked up the function of the 'innodb_page_cleaners' knob in MySQL. I found that it is used to specify the number of page cleaner threads. Then, I checked if there are any special values for this knob. I found that if the value is set to 0, the system will automatically set the number of page cleaner threads to the number of buffer pool instances. Therefore, I concluded that this knob is a 'special knob' because the value 0 has a special meaning.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
