{"think_procedure": "First, understand the function of the 'general_log' knob in MySQL. It is used to enable or disable the general query log. The knob can be set to 'ON' or 'OFF', or 1 or 0, respectively. When set to 'ON' or 1, the general query log is enabled, and when set to 'OFF' or 0, the general query log is disabled. Therefore, the 'general_log' knob can be considered a 'special' knob as it has special values that perform very different functions.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "0 or 'OFF', and 1 or 'ON'"}
