{"think_procedure": "First, I researched the function of the 'temptable_max_ram' knob in MySQL. It is used to limit the maximum amount of memory that can be used by internal temporary tables on a per-query basis. I then checked if there are any special values for this knob that would change its behavior drastically, such as disabling a feature. I found no such evidence or documentation. Therefore, I concluded that it is a regular numerical knob, not a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": false}
