{"think_procedure": "First, I looked at the function of the relay_log_space_limit knob in MySQL. It controls the maximum amount of disk space to use for all relay logs. The default value is 0, which means 'no limit'. If the value is set to a positive number, it represents the maximum space in bytes that the relay logs can occupy. Therefore, it can be considered a 'special' knob because it has a special value (0) that changes its behavior (disabling the limit).", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
