{"think_procedure": "First, I looked up the documentation for the 'innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct' knob in MySQL. I found that this knob is used to specify the percentage of the most recently used pages in each buffer pool to be dumped. The value of this knob ranges from 1 to 100. I did not find any evidence to suggest that this knob has any special values that break the natural order or perform a different function. Therefore, I concluded that this knob is not a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": false}
