{"think_procedure": "First, we need to understand the function of the 'innodb_concurrency_tickets' knob in MySQL. It is used to control the number of tickets a transaction can get from the innodb thread concurrency system. The default value is 5000. If we set this knob to 0, it means that no tickets are granted, and each transaction must wait its turn. This is a significant change in behavior, which suggests that 0 is a special value for this knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
