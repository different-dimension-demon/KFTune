{"think_procedure": "First, I looked up the 'innodb_doublewrite' knob in the MySQL documentation. I found that it is a binary knob that can be set to 0 or 1. When set to 1, the doublewrite buffer is enabled, which adds a layer of reliability to the system. When set to 0, the doublewrite buffer is disabled, which can increase performance but at the risk of data corruption in the event of a crash. Therefore, I concluded that 'innodb_doublewrite' is a special knob because it has a special value (0) that changes its function significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
