The 'innodb_lru_scan_depth' knob in MySQL determines how many blocks to scan for each page made old, and its default value is 1024; however, if your workload is read-heavy, you may increase it to 2048 or 4096, but be cautious as higher values can cause a drop in performance due to increased CPU usage.
